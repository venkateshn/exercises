Amazon.com offers Guaranteed Accelerated Delivery dates on selected items in our stores when you choose One-day or Two-day Express shipping. If the item you purchase is not eligible for Express shipping, we also offer Guaranteed Accelerated Delivery via standard shipping or international shipping when applicable.
</p>
<p>
This means that if you place a qualifying order, we'll prioritize your order so it ships right away and automatically refund the shipping costs if we miss our delivery promise. This service is for eligible items we know we can ship right away, provided with no additional shipping costs, and subject to the terms below.
</p>
<p>
Orders for multiple items, or multiple copies of the same item, may take longer to assemble and may not be eligible for guaranteed delivery, even if the items are listed as eligible. To be eligible for guaranteed delivery on these orders, select the "Ship my items as they become available" option, which means multiple-item orders will be split into multiple shipments and shipping fees charged for each shipment.
</p>
<p>
A delivery appointment may be required for some deliveries. If this is the case, an offer by the carrier of a delivery appointment on or before the guaranteed delivery date meets our delivery guarantee
