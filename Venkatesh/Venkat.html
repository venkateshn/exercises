<p>Welcome to  Mahindra!

<p> More than 65 years later, we're still India's premier utility vehicle (UV) company, but we've also grown quite a bit. In addition to making groundbreaking UVs like the Scorpio and Bolero, Mahindra offers cars, pickups, and commercial vehicles that are rugged, reliable, environmentally friendly, and fuel-efficient. Our global presence means you can find Mahindra vehicles on the roads—both paved and unpaved—of Australia, Europe, Latin America, Malaysia, South Korea, and South Africa. And we're seeking out new terrain every day..</p>

Soon after, in 1889, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Stuttgart designed a vehicle from scratch to be an automobile, rather than a horse-drawn carriage fitted with an engine. They also are usually credited as inventors of the first motorcycle, the Daimler Reitwagen, in 1885, but Italy's Enrico Bernardi, of the University of Padua, in 1882, patented a 0.024 horsepower (17.9 W) 122 cc (7.4 cu in) one-cylinder petrol motor, fitting it into his son's tricycle, making it at least a candidate for the first automobile, and first motorcycle.[1]:p.26 Bernardi enlarged the tricycle in 1892 to carry two adults.</p>

Until 2005, the U.S.A. led the world in total automobile production. In 1929 before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the US automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.[2] In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. By producing 18.3 million units in 2010, China produced nearly twice the number of second place Japan (9.6 million units), with the U.S. in third place with 7.8 million units</p>
